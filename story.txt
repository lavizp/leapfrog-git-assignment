As Zed got on his motorcycle and started the engine, he felt the familiar adrenaline rush that always came with riding in heavy traffic.
He checked his mirrors and made sure his helmet was securely fastened before he pulled out onto the busy street. Cars and trucks zoomed
past him, their horns blaring as they jostled for position in the rush-hour traffic. Zed weaved his way through the chaos, his focus
honed on the road ahead. Suddenly, a car swerved in front of him, cutting him off and forcing him to brake hard. Zed heart raced as
he narrowly avoided a collision. He glared at the driver, who simply shrugged and drove off.

Zed took a deep breath to calm himself down and reminded himself to stay alert. 
He knew that riding a motorcycle in heavy traffic required constant vigilance and quick reflexes. 
With his adrenaline still pumping, he accelerated and merged into a gap in the traffic. 
As he continued on his way, he couldn't shake the feeling of anger and frustration at the careless driver who had cut him off. 
He made a mental note to be even more cautious and defensive in the future, knowing that he couldn't rely on other drivers to always be aware of motorcycles on the road.

Just as Zed was starting to relax, he heard a loud pop and felt his rear tire go flat. He quickly pulled over to the side of the road, cursing his luck. 
As he inspected the tire, he realized that it had been deliberately punctured. 
His anger at the careless driver who had cut him off turned to fear as he realized that someone may have intentionally targeted him. 
He frantically looked around, trying to see if anyone was watching him. 
As he reached for his phone to call for help, he noticed a small note tucked under his bike seat. 
Shaking with trepidation, he unfolded the note, which read: "You shouldn't have crossed me. Consider this a warning." 
Zed's mind raced as he tried to remember if he had ever had a run-in with anyone who would want to harm him. 
He knew that he had to be even more cautious now, not only on the road but also in his personal life. The adrenaline rush he had felt just moments ago now turned into a constant state of anxiety and paranoia.
Curiosity got the better of Zed, and he took the note home. As he flipped through it, the words sent a shiver down his spine. Confusion and disbelief flooded Zedâ€™s mind. He questioned the authenticity of the note, thinking it was nothing more than an elaborate prank. Yet, a sense of curiosity and temptation gnawed at him. What if it was real?
Unable to resist the allure, he scribbled the name of a notorious criminal he had read about in the news. Within seconds, shocking headlines revealed the criminal's sudden demise, leaving Zed paralyzed with a mix of awe and dread.
As news of inexplicable deaths and the emergence of a mysterious vigilante spread, the authorities launched an intensive investigation. A brilliant detective named Detective Madeline White took charge, determined to uncover the truth behind the sudden wave of unexplained deaths.
Unbeknownst to Zed , Detective White  possessed a sharp mind and an unwavering dedication to justice. Her relentless pursuit brought her closer to the truth, leading her to the enigmatic young man at the center of it all.
