As Zed got on his motorcycle and started the engine, he felt the familiar adrenaline rush that always came with riding in heavy traffic.
He checked his mirrors and made sure his helmet was securely fastened before he pulled out onto the busy street. Cars and trucks zoomed
past him, their horns blaring as they jostled for position in the rush-hour traffic. Zed weaved his way through the chaos, his focus
honed on the road ahead. Suddenly, a car swerved in front of him, cutting him off and forcing him to brake hard. Zed heart raced as
he narrowly avoided a collision. He glared at the driver, who simply shrugged and drove off.

Zed took a deep breath to calm himself down and reminded himself to stay alert. 
He knew that riding a motorcycle in heavy traffic required constant vigilance and quick reflexes. 
With his adrenaline still pumping, he accelerated and merged into a gap in the traffic. 
As he continued on his way, he couldn't shake the feeling of anger and frustration at the careless driver who had cut him off. 
He made a mental note to be even more cautious and defensive in the future, knowing that he couldn't rely on other drivers to always be aware of motorcycles on the road.
